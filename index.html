            <h2>What is CSHS?</h2>
            <p>
                CSHS stands for Computer Science Honor Society, and it is a nationwide organization that recognizes high school students who excel in computer science and are passionate about technology. It's more than just a regular honor society; CSHS encourages leadership, service, and a love for computing and technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                Members participate in coding events, outreach programs, and tech-related projects that make a real impact in the school and community. Whether you're into programming, cybersecurity, or just curious about how tech shapes the world, CSHS is a place to grow, collaborate, and inspire others through computer science.
            </p>
            <p>
                The BASIS Phoenix CSHS Chapter was founded in August 2024. Advised by our resident CS teacher, Ms. Yoo, this honor society aims to teach inducted students more about computer science, possible career paths arising from it, and how it can impact our futures.
